# ⚠️ Problem & Solution – VC Deal Room AI

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Venture capital due diligence still operates in the **dark ages** — slow, expensive, and largely manual.  
Despite the rise of AI across industries, investment analysis remains trapped in spreadsheets, emails, and static reports.

### 💣 The Core Challenges
1. **Time-Consuming** – Each deal takes **3–6 weeks** for financial and market validation.  
2. **High Cost** – VCs spend **$50K–$100K per deal** on consultants, analysts, and experts.  
3. **Low Coverage** – Due to resource limits, firms reject **99% of startups** before proper analysis.  
4. **Subjectivity** – Human bias and inconsistent criteria lead to missed high-potential investments.  
5. **Fragmented Systems** – Financial data, pitch decks, and market intelligence live in disconnected tools.

> 🧠 Result: Capital allocation is inefficient, innovation funding is delayed, and startups lose opportunities.
